# USBMOUNT - EQmod  USB-C convertor
Control your mount directly from  computer. 

Skywatcher mounts are very popular among amateur astronomers due to their adorable price and good quality. In the GoTo versions, they are equipped with a hand control with which the user can find an object or perform basic service operations. However, these mounts can be connected to a computer and greatly expand its capabilities.

## How to use

### Connection
The USBMOUNT is connected instead of the hand control. It provides full mount functionality.

* **To computer:** It is simple :) Only connect USBMOUNT to computer with USB-C cable. You can use, for example, the one you use for your smartphone. `PC (pwr)` LED should appear. It is recommended to use a quality cable to ensure a permanent and high-quality connection. 
* **To mount:**  For connection to the assembly, the converter is equipped with an RJ45 connector. You can use a cable that you connect to the hand control or a direct Ethernet cable to connect. (If your mount have an RJ45 connector - see the table below). After successful connection to the assembly, the `MOUNT (pwr)` LED should light up. 

> It is expected that the mount is powered and switched on.

### Mounting
The expected installation is using 3M DualLock Reclosable Fastener. (It is included in the package.) For gluing it is necessary to first degrease the surface and after gluing, keep it pressed for some time

If you need to operate the USBMOUNT (EQmod) over long distances, it is better to prefer a longer cable on the telescope side (RJ45). You can use a standard (straight) ethernet cable here. I recommend a shielded one. The length of the USB should not exceed 5m. Even with a shorter cable, the USB connection may not work reliably. 

### LED indicators
USBMOUNT is equipted with 4 LED diods. Two red ones indicate the presence of power in coresponding (nearest) connector. Simply if it is connected. The other two orange diods show data transfer. `TX` indicating data from computer to your mount. The `RX` is in the opposite direction.
